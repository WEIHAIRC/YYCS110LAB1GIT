## Personal Information
My name is Yang Yue. I am 20 years old. I grew up in Beijing, China, and my hometown is Shandong. My hobby is soccer. I am humorous and friendly :joy:

## Academic
I am a second-year student of Warren College, UCSD. I have strong interests in **Graph Theory** and **Combinatorics**. They are powerful tools for Computer Science. Currently, I am taking Computer Science and Mathematics courses at the same time. I have learned programming in Python, Java, and C/C++ at UCSD. You are welcome to communicate with me. 

## Motto
Li, Bai, one of the greatest Chinese ancient poem says:
>"长风破浪会有时，直挂云帆济沧海"
>*I believe that one day, we can ride the long wind to break through the waves, hang up the cloud sail high, and march forward bravely in the sea.*
That motto encourages people to be persistent and believe that difficulties can finally be overcome.
I want to encourage myself by this motto: we can finally overcome difficulties of COVID-19.

## My Tasks of 2021:
- [ ] Socialize before going back to UCSD
- [x] Visit hometown Weifang, Shandong
- [x] Visit hometown Weihai, Shandong
- [x] Travel for at least 1 time (except visiting hometown)
- [ ] Be unavailable
- [ ] Be admitted by an intern or summer research program (*before May*)
- [ ] Mitigate my procrastination
